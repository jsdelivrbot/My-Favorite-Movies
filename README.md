# My-Favorite-Movies

A RESTful web-app for managing favorite movies.
A user can search for movies, add those to a preference list with personal comments and ratings, and then view sample trailers from YouTube.

This is a demo app of ES6, Bootstrap, React-Redux front-end framework with NodeJS/Express as backend, transacting to THE MOVIE DB and YouTube using the REST APIs.
