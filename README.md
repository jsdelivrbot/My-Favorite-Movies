# My-Favorite-Movies

A RESTful web-app for managing favorite movies.
A user can search for movies, add those to a preference list with personal comments and ratings.

This is a demo app of React-Redux front-end framework with NodeJS as backend, transacting to THE MOVIE DB and YouTube using the REST APIs.

  3) scroll down the search list (if there are search results) and select an item of interest (the movie panel as the page's body will render a YouTube movie trailer and will also show the movie profile from the THE MOVIE DB website)
  4) click the star rating and add a comment
  5) at the bottom of the movie panel are the buttons to add/remove a selected movie to/from the preference list; another button is provided to clear the preference list
